##  Component-Based Architecture

This project follows a **modular component-based structure** to ensure **maintainability and scalability**.

###  Folder Structure
  
`📦 src`  
 `┣ 📂 components    # Reusable UI Components`  
 `┣ 📂 Tests         # Test cases for Componenets`  
 `┣ 📜 App.tsx       # Main Application Entry`  
 `┗ 📜 index.tsx     # Root File`

##  Performance Optimization

###  Optimizations Implemented

✔️ **Lazy Loading** with `React.lazy()`  
✔️ **Code Splitting** via dynamic imports  
✔️ **Optimized Images** with correct formats  
✔️ **Minified Tailwind CSS**  
✔️ **Fast Build Time** using Vite

---

##  Coding Standards

To maintain **code quality and consistency**, the following **ESLint rules** were enforced:  
✔️ **Single Quotes (`'`) instead of Double Quotes (`"`).**  
✔️ **Strict Equality (`===` instead of `==`).**  
✔️ **No Trailing Spaces.**  
✔️ **No Unused Variables.**

---

##  Testing Implementation

###  Testing Approach:

* **Unit Tests** using `Jest` & `React Testing Library`.  
* **Component Testing** for UI validation.

---

##  Challenges & Learnings

### Challenges Faced

* Implementing **pixel-perfect** responsiveness.  
* Ensuring **strict TypeScript typings**.  
* Managing **lazy-loaded components efficiently**.
* Animation **Adding Animations using Tailwind**.


### Learnings & Takeaways:

* **Tailwind CSS** significantly speeds up styling.  
* **Lazy Loading** improves performance without affecting UX.  
* **ESLint & Prettier** ensure **consistent code quality**.

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Add **Animations** using Framer Motion.  
* Implement **Dark Mode**.  
* Improve **SEO & Metadata Optimization**.  
* Enhance **Form Validation** with better error handling.
* Implement **Authentication & Security Best Practices**.
* Add **Husky for Git Hooks** to enforce linting and formatting before commits.
* Integrate **Telemetry & Analytics** for performance monitoring and user insights.
* Introduce **Redux for State Management** to handle global application state efficiently.
